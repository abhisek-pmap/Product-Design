# Design Team
Design Team Sandbox including Tools, Tricks, Gists, Markdowns, etc.

These are the directions for setting up the dev environment for those who are using **Mac computers**. 

**If you are using a Windows computer, refer to the README file [here](https://github.com/ProcessMAP/Design-Team/blob/master/windows-setup.md).**

>#### Important Note:
> If you haven't done so, please create a new github account with your username ending with "**-pmap**", e.g., "jsmith-pmap", so we can invite you to collaborate in our repositories.


## Basic Software Configuration
The list below consists of the essential software apps, plugins and command line packages our team members get when joining the Product Design group at ProcessMAP.

We encourage you to install the following by yourself - just follow the list - so you get familiar with what the tools you will have at your disposal.

# Command Line Accelerators

## 1. Install Xcode
Xcode is Apple's development environment for creating apps. Download it from:
[http://developer.apple.com/xcode](http://developer.apple.com/xcode)

	You must agree to the license by opening Xcode.app before proceeding.

The next set of commands and applications will require the use of `Terminal`. Install the Command Line Tools from Xcode:

	xcode-select --install

## 2. Homebrew - Package Manager
Homebrew [http://brew.sh](http://brew.sh) is a package management system that simplifies the installation of software on the Mac OS X operating system.  

Homebrew will make the installation process easier.

Open `Terminal` and enter the following command:

    ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

- Press ENTER to continue.
- Enter System Password (your login password)
- After installation is complete, be sure to run the following command:

    `brew doctor`

Wait for the message: `Your system is ready to brew.` and you are good to start **installing Git**.


## 3. Git - Source Control
Git is a distributed version control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed. Now that youâ€™ve got Homebrew installed, use it to install Git from within your `Terminal` by entering the following command line:

	brew install git

The Git installation is straightforward, but to confirm, test the install with the following command, to check Git's version:

	git version

## 4. Node.Js - Low-level Server Platform
Node.js is a software platform that is used to build scalable network applications. Node.js utilizes JavaScript as its scripting language, and achieves high throughput via non-blocking I/O and a single-threaded event loop.

Once again, Homebrew makes it easy to install the latest stable version for Node.js. Simply enter the following:

	brew install node

This should take about 4 minutes. Confirm the installation by checking Node latest version:

	node -v

And the great news is that Node Package Management (NPM) is also installed. Previous versions you had to install `npm` separately. Test it out:

	npm -v

Let me explain a bit about NPM if you are not familiar.

>### Important Note About NPM
NPM is a NodeJS package manager. As its name would imply, you can use it to install node programs. Also, if you use it in development, it makes it easier to specify and link dependencies.

>I strongly encourage you not to do package management with sudo! Packages can run arbitrary scripts, which makes sudoing a package manager command as safe as a chainsaw-haircut. Sure, it's fast and definitely going to cut through any obstacles, but you might actually want that obstacle to stay there.

>I recommend doing this once instead:

>	`sudo chown -R $USER /usr/local`

> That sets your user account as the owner of the /usr/local directory, so that you can just issue normal commands in there. Then you won't ever have to use sudo when you install node or issue npm commands.

## 5. Gulp - JavaScript Task Runner

Gulp is a JS task runner that lets you automate tasks such as:
- Bundling and minifying libraries and stylesheets
- Less/Sass to CSS compilation
- Refreshing your browser when you save a file
- Quickly running unit tests and running code analysis
- Copying modified files to an output directory

Type in the following into the command line:
```
	npm install -g gulp
```
which should print a version number, so you'll see something similar to `CLI version 3.9.0`.

The **-g** is an _optional_ flag used to signify that we want to install this package globally so that any project can use it. Check the command line to ensure that there are no error messages. Type in the following in the command line:
```
	gulp -v
```

## 6. Bower - The Package Manager for the Web
Bower [http://bower.io](http://bower.io) is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.

Bower is THE Package Manager to have if you want to manage installation dependencies for web development components, like AngulaJs, jQuery, etc.

Install Bower through `npm` as follows:

	sudo npm install -g bower

## 7. Sass - Stylesheet Language

Open up Terminal and type in the following:
```
	gem install sass
```
Hit Enter/Return and wait for Sass to be installed. If you get an error message, then you will need to use the `sudo` command to install the Sass gem, as follows: `sudo gem install sass`

Ensure that Sass is installed by running the following in the command line: 
```
	sass -v
```

You should see something similar to `Sass 3.4.19 (Selective Steve)`.

## 8. Web Font Load

- Easily install ALL of [Google's Web Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) using the command line below. Learn more about this command on [qrpike's GitHub](https://github.com/qrpike/Web-Font-Load) in your terminal:
```
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qrpike/Web-Font-Load/master/install.sh | sh
```
