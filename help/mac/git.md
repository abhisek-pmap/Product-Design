### 3. Git - Source Control
Git is a distributed version control and source code management (SCM) system with an emphasis on speed. Now that youâ€™ve got Homebrew installed, use it to install Git from within your `Terminal` by entering the following command line:

	brew install git

The Git installation is straightforward, but to confirm, test the install with the following command, to check Git's version:

	git version

#### GitHub Desktop Application
