### 6. Sass - Stylesheet Language

Open up Terminal and type in the following:
```
	gem install sass
```
Hit Enter/Return and wait for Sass to be installed. If you get an error message, then you will need to use the `sudo` command to install the Sass gem, as follows: `sudo gem install sass`

Ensure that Sass is installed by running the following in the command line: 
```
	sass -v
```

You should see something similar to `Sass 3.4.19 (Selective Steve)`.
