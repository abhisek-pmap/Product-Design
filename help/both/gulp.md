### Gulp - JavaScript Task Runner

Gulp is a JS task runner that lets you automate tasks such as:
- Bundling and minifying libraries and stylesheets
- Less/Sass to CSS compilation
- Refreshing your browser when you save a file
- Quickly running unit tests and running code analysis
- Copying modified files to an output directory

Type in the following into the command line:
```
	npm install -g gulp
```

The **-g** is an _optional_ flag used to signify that we want to install this package globally so that any project can use it. Check the command line to ensure that there are no error messages. Type in the following in the command line:
```
	gulp -v
```
which should print a version number, so you'll see something similar to `CLI version 3.9.0`.
