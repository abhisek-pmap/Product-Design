### Bower - The Package Manager for the Web
Bower [http://bower.io](http://bower.io) is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack. There are no system wide dependencies, no dependencies are shared between different apps, and the dependency tree is flat.

Bower is THE Package Manager to have if you want to manage installation dependencies for web development components, like AngulaJs, jQuery, etc.

Install Bower through `npm` as follows:

	sudo npm install -g bower
